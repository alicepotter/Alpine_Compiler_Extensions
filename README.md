# Extending the Alpine Compiler
CS-320 : Computer Language Processing, Alice Potter, Cassio Manuguerra, Jules Schneuwly, Group 50

A report presenting our extensions to the Alpine compiler can be found in the Git repository. 

To test our C transpiler, please follow these steps:

1. Enter the `sbt` command in the terminal.
2. Enter the command :`run -s ./Name_of_the_test`.

We have created several tests that you can use to verify the functionality.
